# compilation-of-crummy-code
A collection of really bad code. Code that is useless, really badly written, or any other way code can be bad!

Feel free to add to this repository!!! (I'll probably accept everything, even not really bad code)

*this is not a serious repository, I would not recommend using any code in here in an actual project.
